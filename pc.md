## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? It is a tool used for source code management
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is the actual tool we use and github is a place we can manage our repositories in the cloud.
3. Why do we create a branch? So others can se the changes I made specifically to repository
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To let others know I made     changes to a respository.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout or git switch
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch is a command to download the contents of a remote repository. Git merge is a way to combine multiple branches. And git pull is used to fetch and download from a remote repository and update your local repository to match the content. 
7. What is a merge conflict? It is what happens when Git is unable to automatically resolve the differences in code between two different commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Go to the specific repository with the conflict and look at the pull requests that have been made. There should be a clickable butoon  to resolve the conflict. And you can choose to go with one or the other, or create a new repository.
